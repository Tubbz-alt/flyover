Flyover
------- 

What's that plane flying overhead? 

I live underneath a flight path for airplanes arriving at LaGuardia Airport in New York. When I hear the planes, I get curious. Where are those people coming from? I wrote this to find out.

Theoretically Askable Questions
===============================

*Are you a NIMBY who is opposed to noise, airplanes, travel, etc.?*

Nah. I can hear the planes, but it's not really annoying. I'm not worried or angry, just curious about the world around me... :)

I do have a cat named Nimby though.

*But airplanes flying overhead could crash on you! They are dangerous!*

No, they're not. Please don't contact me anymore.

TODO
====
- only include flights going to LGA overhead, with a polygon (maybe excluding flights overhead above a certain altitude)
   (alternatively, only include flights going to LGA by combining the two scripts that determine the nearest flight and determine where it's going to INSTEAD find the nearest flight going to LGA.)
- look up airport names for non-US airports and display them too. (Where right now we'd display EGLL, we should instead display EGLL (London Heathrow, UK)).

I would like to thank the Academy...
